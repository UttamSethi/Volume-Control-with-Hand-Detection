# Volume Control with Hand Detection üéõÔ∏è‚úã

## Description
This is a Python project that uses computer vision to control the system volume with hand gestures. By leveraging OpenCV and MediaPipe, the application detects hand movements and adjusts the volume in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Detection:** Uses webcam input to track hand gestures.
- **Volume Control:** Adjusts system volume based on hand movement.
- **Intuitive Gestures:** Move your hand closer or farther apart to increase or decrease the volume.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works smoothly with your system's audio settings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:UttamSethi/Volume-Control-with-Hand-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Volume-Control-with-Hand-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
1. Connect a webcam to your system.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python volume_control.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to use hand gestures for controlling the volume.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **OpenCV:** For computer vision and image processing.
- **MediaPipe:** For hand detection and gesture tracking.
- **PyCaw:** For interacting with the system's audio.

## Gesture Controls
- **Increase Volume:** Move your thumb and index finger farther apart.
- **Decrease Volume:** Bring your thumb and index finger closer together.
